Oracle JET boilerplate application for quick start POC & production grade application development.

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Clone from master
2. Navigate to project root in command line and run "npm install"
3. Run "ojet serve" - the boilerplate app will launch and default to a web theme

This application comes built with a Jasmine+Karma unit test framework in place. Code coverage is essential to development tasks.

Testing & Coverage:

1. Tests and coverage can be run by entering "karma start"
2. A folder named reports will be created on the first run and contains all coverage reports for testing

This boiler plate application is bundled with JET v5.1.0

Tips:

1. This app is ready for offline development using mock REST calls, observe settings in serviceconfig.js to manage this
2. There are two existing app UI elements built into this boilerplate, a busy status, and a toast message. Observe the appui.js file for further detail
3. A feature control management system is in place, this can be found in main.js & featureControl.json
